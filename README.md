## ⚡ Project Overview

**Energy Credit (ENE)** bridges blockchain with tangible use, prioritizing operational adoption over speculation.  
ENE’s utility begins with **real businesses** and **on-site experiences**:

- 💳 **In-store payments** at partner venues (starting with *La Vista 360*, Punta del Este).  
- 🎟️ **Digital entertainment**: arcade ticketing and interactive experiences (*Punta Bowling* project).  
- 🎁 **Loyalty & reward system** for customers paying with ENE.  
- 🌐 **Progressive integration** into new physical and digital merchants.

ENE was not conceived as a financial fantasy but as a functional, transparent, and sustainable token ecosystem.
